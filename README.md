# Kotlin Demo Generics

Kotlin Generics are a way of writing reusable code that works with different types. Generics allow you to write code that can be used with any type of data, rather than being limited to a specific type.

In Kotlin, you can define generic classes, interfaces, and functions using the angle bracket syntax <T>, where T is a type parameter. You can then use this type parameter within your code to represent any type.
